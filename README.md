# Overview

As a software engineer, I want to learn as many things as I can, so I'm learning a new programming language called Java. It's a language with rich features, and I'm watching videos, reading documentation, and asking for help from people I know to further my understanding, aiming to become a more capable and creative software engineer.

I built a weather app that shows the weather for today and tomorrow using an API called Open-Meteo. For my app, I also wanted to get the user's city to display their weather when the app launches, so I used another API called ip-api to get the user's city from their IP. My app displays the weather conditions, windspeed, humidity, temperature, and an image depending on the weather. It also allows users to input a city and view the weather for any city worldwide.

I wrote this program and consider it a great first project because it uses APIs, GUI, functions, methods, and objects. It introduced me to many aspects of this great programming language and made me think about and compare it to other languages.

I made two videos: one shorter video that shows the program and a walkthrough of the code, focusing on what I learned about the syntax, and one longer video explaining everything in more detail.

# Development Environment

I have used visual studio code as code editor

I have used Java, and libraries as Swing, awt, imageio, time, io, util

# Future Work

- I need to handle some errors that can be showed when user introduce no valid data
- I can make an object of type weather and create the variables I need display the weather information, so I can call that object twice and store it in one variable called todayWeather and other called tomorrowWeather, to no repeat code that is similar
- Improve the GUI
